# setsm_postprocessing_python
Methods for filtering and mosaicking DEMs produced by [SETSM](https://github.com/setsmdeveloper/SETSM "SETSM on GitHub") in batch, written in Python.
The methodology for both filtering and mosaicking is largely ported from [MATLAB code written by Ian Howat](https://github.com/ihowat/setsm_postprocessing "setsm_postprocessing on GitHub"), glaciologist and professor of Earth Sciences at The Ohio State University.
